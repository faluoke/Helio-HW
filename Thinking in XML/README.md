# Stretch your Thoughts

- ## How do you think XML relates to HTML?
  - They are both markup languages, XML is used mostly to store data, whereas HTML is the markup for the web.
- ## What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?
  - It very clearly defines the data, its attribute and what it is describing.
- ## What are some disadvantages?
  - In my view XML can get very messy when storing large amounts of data, that could be why JSON's become the standard.
